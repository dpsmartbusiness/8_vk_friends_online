# Watcher of Friends Online

Program shows list of full names from [vk](https://vk.com) friends online in console.

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

Example of program results:

```bash

Enter vk login: your_login
Enter vk password: #Your password is not shows when entering by security reasons 

Vk friends online:
                some_name_1
                some_name_2
                ...
                some_name_n

```
